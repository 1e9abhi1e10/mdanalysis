Coordinates modules
**************************

The coordinates module contains the classes to read and write
trajectories. Typically, MDAnalysis recognizes :ref:`Supported coordinate
formats` by the file extension and hence most users probably do not need to
concern themselves with classes and functions described here.

Programmers and anyone trying to implement new functionality should read the
:ref:`Trajectory API` (described in :mod:`MDAnalysis.coordinates`).

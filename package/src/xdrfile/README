libxdrfile2.0
=============

This library allows to read GROMACS trr and xtc files and also to
convert from one format to another. The original `libxdr library`_ was
written by the Gromacs developers. For MDAnalysis we added Python
bindings (generated with SWIG_). For libxdrfile2.0 we added new indexing
and seeking capabilities to the library.

Licensing
=========

The library was initially provided by the Gromacs developers under the
GNU Lesser General Public License version 3.
While under development together with the MDAnalysis code, the library
was enhanced to provide xtc/trr frame indexing and seeking. This improved
version of the library, named libxdrfile2.0, is now provided under the GNU
General Public License version 3. Read the AUTHORS and COPYING files
for details.


Python bindings
===============

Although the whole ``xdrfile`` package is distributed together with
`MDAnalysis <http://mdanalysis.googlecode.com>` it is also possible to
use it as a stand-alone library. Build the library from the src
directory::

  mv xdrfile/setup_py setup.py
  mv xdrfile/__init___py xdrfile/__init__.py 
  swig -python xdrfile/libxdrfile.i   # or copy libxdrfile.py to xdrfile/
  python setup.py build --build-lib=.

(This does an in-place build but you can also do a normal ``python
setup.py install``.)

Note that in order to import the module you will have to do::

  from xdrfile import libxdrfile

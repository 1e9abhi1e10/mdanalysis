  MDAnalysis Repository README
================================

MDAnalysis is a Python toolkit to analyze molecular dynamics
trajectories generated by CHARMM, Amber, NAMD, LAMMPS, or Gromacs.

Source code is hosted in a git repository at

       http://mdanalysis.googlecode.com/

This is the top level of the master repository. It contains

     1. the MDAnalysis toolkit source files in the directory

          package/

     2. the unit tests together with any input files required for
        running those tests in the directory

          testsuite/

The directory 'maintainer' contains scripts only needed for
maintaining releases and are not generally useful for the user or the
typical developer.

(For more details on the directory layout see `Issue 87`_ on the
MDAnalysis issue tracker.)

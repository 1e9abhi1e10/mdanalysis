Coordinates modules
**************************

The coordinates module contains the classes to read and write
trajectories. Typically, MDAnalysis recognizes formats by the file
extension and hence most users probably do not need to concern
themselves with classes and functions described here.

Programmers and anyone trying to implement new functionality should
read the **Trajectory API** that is described in
:mod:`MDAnalysis.coordinates`.

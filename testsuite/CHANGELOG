 MDAnalysisTestData CHANGELOG
==============================

The rules for this file:
  * entries are sorted newest-first.
  * summarize sets of changes - don't reproduce every subversion log comment here.
  * don't ever delete anything.
  * keep the format consistent (79 char width, M/D/Y date format) and do not
    use tabs but use spaces for formatting

  * 0.7.5

    - test package is now called 'MDAnalysisTests'
    - tests AND data are now bundled together in MDAnalysisTests
    - MDAnalysis and MDAnalysisTests packages MUST have the same
      release number (they need to stay in sync); MDAnalysisTests
      will NOT run if a release mismatch is detected
    - see Issue #87 and 
      https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/wiki/UnitTests

  * 0.7.4

    - Split off test data trajectories and structures from
      MDAnalaysis/tests/data into separate package. (Issue 28) 

    - Numbering matches the earliest MDAnalysis release for which the data is
      needed. Any later releases of MDAnalysis will also use these test data
      unless a MDAnalysisTestData package with a higher release number is
      available.
